# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

I used the template provided in this link to build my binary search function: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-in-javascript/ I used this link to help me discover a recursion problem I was having with my return value: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69868619/recursion-in-javascript-question-how-is-the-position-of-console-log-here-affect

I received advice from Lars Kothoff and the TA during lab section 10.
